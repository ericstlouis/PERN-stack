## Description
I made this todo app utilizing the PERN stack which is basically
- postgres
- Express
- React
- Node.js
  
This todo app focus on using the basic CRUD operation, interacting with the postgres database using a RESTful api build using express and node.js

###Description
I learned a lot using this stack. This is my first time using express to build an api
I also used Chakra ui for the time with made creating the ui 10x easier.
